This is a repo for the code I wrote for Udacity's Image Classifier Project, which creates an image classifier application.
This application can identify the correct category and matching name with at least 70% accuracy.

The code takes in user arguments to define and train a network (train.py).
Once trained, a user can then add additional arguments, including an image file, to predict what kind of classification the image is of (predict.py).
To be safe, the user can also input the number of top classes (topk) they want to see when running predict.py. It defaults to 5 classes, and will therefore show the top 5 predictions if no input is given.

The arguments the user can put into a command line prompt are listed in get_input_args.py.

The Image Classifier Project html and ipynb files contain all the functions written at the outset of the project.
Some were used in the command line application section, some were not. These files mostly serve as a reference for everything written before the command line application, but are no necessary to use the application.

The functions fo the classifier were written using Jupyter Notebooks.
